This is a set of 100 photographs that have reached featured picture status on Wikimedia Commons and are also in the public domain. Originally, this set of photographs was created to test a photo processing application.

The entire set of 100 photos is available [here](https://github.com/waitblock/wikimedia-commons-fp-set/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) as a ZIP file. Uncompressed, the pictures take up a little more than 1 GB.

Individual pictures can be accessed from this repository or the web. Each photo has an ID number from 00-99, which corresponds to its filename in this repository and on the web. To access pictures from the web, use the URL https://waitblock.github.io/wikimedia-commons-fp-set/images/--.jpg, where -- is replaced by the photo's ID number.

To find the source on Wikimedia Commons for each photo, please refer to the [website](https://waitblock.github.io/wikimedia-commons-fp-set/).
